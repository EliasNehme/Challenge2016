### Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy - Software Benchmarking ###

This is a repository of code written for the Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy Challenge (2016-2019).

More information about this challenge is here [SMLM](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/smlm/challenge2016/index.html)

Bandwidth limitations on github make storing all the PSFs here impractical. 

Download the PSF zip from the main website [section Methods PSF] (http://bigwww.epfl.ch/smlm/challenge2016/index.html?p=methods#3).
